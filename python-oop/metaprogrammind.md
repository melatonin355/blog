Metaprogramming is the technique of writing code that can manipulate other code at runtime. In Python, this can be achieved through the use of introspection and reflection, which allow you to inspect and modify objects and classes at runtime. 

Introspection refers to the ability of a program to examine its own state and the state of other objects at runtime. In Python, you can use built-in functions such as `type()` and `dir()` to inspect the type and attributes of objects. 

Reflection refers to the ability of a program to modify its own behavior at runtime. In Python, you can achieve reflection through the use of metaclasses, which are classes that define the behavior of other classes. 

Here is an ASCII diagram to illustrate how metaclasses work in Python:

```
                 ┌─────────────────┐
                 │      Object     │
                 └─────────────────┘
                         ▲
                         │
                 ┌─────────────────┐
                 │       type      │
                 └─────────────────┘
                         ▲
                         │
         ┌─────────────┬─┴─────────────┬─────────────┐
         │             │               │             │
┌───────────────┐┌───────────────┐┌───────────────┐┌───────────────┐
│  MyClass1     ││  MyClass2     ││  MyClass3     ││   ...         │
└───────────────┘└───────────────┘└───────────────┘└───────────────┘
```

In Python, classes are themselves objects, and they are instances of the `type` class. When you define a class in Python, it is actually an instance of the `type` class that is created at runtime. 

Metaclasses allow you to customize the behavior of the `type` class and control how classes are created. You can define a metaclass by creating a new class that inherits from `type`. The metaclass can then define custom behavior that will be applied to all classes created with that metaclass.

Here is an example of how you can define a metaclass in Python:

```
class MyMetaClass(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        # Customize behavior here
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)

class MyClass(metaclass=MyMetaClass):
    # Class definition here
```

In this example, `MyMetaClass` is a custom metaclass that inherits from `type`. The `__new__()` method is a special method that is called when a new class is created. You can override this method in your metaclass to customize the behavior of class creation.

When you define a new class `MyClass` using the `metaclass` parameter, Python will use `MyMetaClass` as the metaclass for the new class. This means that any customization you defined in `MyMetaClass` will be applied to `MyClass`.

In summary, metaprogramming in Python allows you to write code that can manipulate other code at runtime. You can achieve this through the use of introspection and reflection, as well as through the use of metaclasses to customize the behavior of class creation.
