# Helm Notes


1. **Installing Helm**:
   - To install Helm, use the package manager suitable for your operating system (e.g., Homebrew on macOS, Chocolatey on Windows, apt-get on Ubuntu).
   - After installation, initialize Helm on your cluster using the `helm init` command.

2. **Creating a Helm Chart**:
   - Use the `helm create` command followed by the chart name to create a new Helm chart.
   - Edit the generated files, such as `Chart.yaml` (metadata), `values.yaml` (default configuration values), and `templates/` (Kubernetes manifests).
   - Customize the chart according to your application's requirements.

3. **Packaging and Deploying the Chart**:
   - Use the `helm package` command to package your chart into a compressed archive (.tgz file).
   - To install the chart, use the `helm install` command followed by the chart name and the release name.
   - Provide any necessary configuration overrides using the `--set` flag or a values file with the `--values` flag.

4. **Managing Releases**:
   - Use the `helm list` command to view the list of installed releases.
   - To upgrade a release, use the `helm upgrade` command followed by the release name and the chart name.
   - To uninstall a release, use the `helm uninstall` command followed by the release name.

5. **Chart Templating**:
   - Utilize the Go template language to define dynamic values in your Helm charts.
   - Access and manipulate values using functions like `tpl`, `toYaml`, `default`, etc.
   - Leverage control structures like `if`, `range`, and `with` to conditionally generate resources.

6. **Versioning and Dependencies**:
   - Specify the chart version in `Chart.yaml` using the `version` field.
   - Define dependencies in `Chart.yaml` under the `dependencies` section.
   - Use the `helm dependency update` command to fetch/update chart dependencies.

7. **CI/CD with Helm**:
   - Integrate Helm into your CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
   - Use tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or CircleCI to manage Helm releases.
   - Consider using Helm plugins or custom scripts to facilitate the deployment process.

8. **Configuration Management**:
   - Utilize values files to manage different configurations for your chart.
   - Override values during installation or upgrade using `--set` or `--values` flags.
   - Use `--set-string` for values that need to be treated as strings.

9. **Securing Helm Deployments**:
   - Apply RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to restrict access to Helm.
   - Use Tiller (the server-side component of Helm) with proper security configurations.
   - Store sensitive information like credentials in Kubernetes secrets.

10. **Scaling and Updating Applications**:
    - Utilize Kubernetes scaling mechanisms (e.g., `replicas`) in your chart's manifests.
    - Use the `helm upgrade` command to apply changes to the deployed chart.
    - Perform rolling updates to minimize application downtime.

11. **Troubleshooting Helm Deployments**:
    - Use `helm status` and `helm get` commands to retrieve information about releases.
    - Inspect logs of individual resources using `kubectl logs`.
    - Debug Helm deployments by examining generated manifests and values.

12. **Monitoring Helm Deployments**:
    - Utilize Kubernetes-native monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
